# Dielectron Collision Analysis in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing dielectron collision events from particle collision data.  
The analysis focuses on visualizing and interpreting the collision patterns using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Environment Setup

- **Programming language**: Python  
- **Version**: Python 3.11.10  
- **Environment**: Anaconda, using the `python_env` virtual environment

## Repository Contents

- **Report**: The report detailing the analysis and findings is included in the repository.
- **Dataset**: The dataset of dielectron collision events is obtained from Kaggle, which is based on data extracted from CERN's open data.
- **Visual Results**: Visualizations such as scatter plots, pair plots, and histograms generated from the data are also included.

## Future Work

This analysis is based on a limited dataset, and future work should focus on:
- Background estimation
- Refining event selection
- Increasing the statistics to improve the sensitivity to potential signals
- Further investigating the high mass tail
- Including detector effects and systematic uncertainties to improve the precision of the results
